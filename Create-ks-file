Process to create a kickstarter file

I'm lazy so I'll manually install the server and save the ks.cfg onto a USB Drive. This will give me a correctly formatted kickstarter file with most of the information in it. You can skip this step if you download my kickstarter file and modify it.

Things of note

Ethernet must be manually turned on 
My DHCP server configured the interface


Manually partition “I will configure partitioning”
This machine has a 500GB hard drive and will contain about 3 virtual machines so I will create a separate partition for them about 400GB in size
That means all other parts need to fit in about 100GB

Use LVM
/boot 500MB
     must be sda1
swap 24GB
     Change volume group to VG00 
     Everything but boot goes in this volume group
     Who knows how to size swap now days. I'll make it the size of ram
/usr 20GB
/   2GB
/tmp 5GB
     Crash dumps go here so... make this much bigger if you want them
/var 20GB
     Redhat likes to keep the rpm database in here, updates eventually get large
/home  5GB
     Can be small only admin work
/var/log 10GB
     Logs need to work until I can establish a log server elseware 
/var/lib/libvirt/images 300GB
On larger drives give this as much space as you can my kickstarter file will be configured to let this grow to the end of disk

Making the boot media

Inset a 8GB or larger USB drive in your workstation.
My cammand to copy the installation media was:

sudo dd if=~/BackUp/ISO/CentOS/CentOS-7.0-1406-x86_64-DVD.iso of=/dev/sdb bs=512k

I booted the media and hit tab

I added this to the boot line:

ks=hd:/dev/sda2/ks.cfg
