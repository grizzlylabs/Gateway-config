# Gateway-config
Installs and configures a gateway Linux machine

This project bootstraps my home server network by managing serveral factors

1. automated install CentOS 7 Onto a Intel based server
2. Use kickstarter
3. Establishes two networks -- Internet and Internal
4. Installs a SSH server
5. Documents the process


Here is the idea

I need to bootstrap a (home) data center. I will use this device as a gateway to an operations network.
