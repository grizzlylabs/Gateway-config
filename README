# Gateway-config
Installs and configures a gateway Linux machine

This project bootstraps my home server network by managing serveral factors

1. automated install CentOS 7 Onto a Intel based server
2. Use kickstart
3. Establishes two networks -- Internet and Internal
4. Installs a SSH server
5. Uses CentOS Virtual Machine install option
6. Documents the process


Here is the idea

I need to bootstrap a (home) data center. I will use this device as a gateway to an operations network. This device will have a KVM VM on it that implements the Cobbler deployment system.

The Cobbler VM will be a separate project, but this project will set up the base system with the ability to automatically create a working VM using KVM.
